```html
<div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
  <!-- Content here -->
</div>
```
This code uses Tailwind's gradient feature to create a background that transitions from blue to purple.  However, if the `shadow-md` class is applied *after* the gradient, it might not render correctly, especially in some browsers. The shadow could obscure parts of the gradient or appear distorted.
