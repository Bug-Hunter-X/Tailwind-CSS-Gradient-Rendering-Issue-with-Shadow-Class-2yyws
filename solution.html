```html
<div class="z-10 bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-500 to-purple-500 p-4 rounded-lg shadow-md">
  <!-- Content here -->
</div>
```
By adding the `z-10` class to increase the z-index, we ensure that the gradient is rendered on top of the shadow, preventing overlap.  Alternatively, using `inset-shadow` could also provide a better result.
